1. The way to add comments on ruby (inline - multiline)
   There are two ways to add comments in ruby
	for inline comments we should use the number sign(#) at the begining of the comment
	# inline comment

	For multiline comments we should use =begin and =end, see the following example
	=begin
		comment first line
		comment second line
	=end

2. When you should use each type
   inline comments is for notes and trivial information
   multiline comments is for code documentation

3. create and script using inline-multiline comments

# This is an inline comment

puts "This is and example of comments"

=begin
this is 
my multiline
=end
