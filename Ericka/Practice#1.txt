a) the way to add comments on ruby (inline - multiline)
	to make an inline comment on ruby we must use the character "#"
	and to make a multiline comments on ruby, we use the next format with its 
	characters:
		
		=begin
		comment line
		comment line
		=end
	
b) when you should use each type

inline comments only when we want to specify a variable or
a detail of little modification in our code, just a line.

however, multiline comments could be when specified for details
full functionality of the class in question , for example.

c) create and script using inline-multiline comments

print "first line"
#in the first line up we are using "print"
puts "second line"
#in the second line up we are using "puts"
print "third line"
puts "hello"
print "world"
puts "BDT"
print "jalasoft"
=begin
	
that is a script with the objetive to 
see the difference between "print"
and "puts" for the BDT class 	
=end

3. Put a  # (octothorpe, hash, pound) character at the beginning of any line. What did it do?

the character "#" in front of the first line, provoked than the line is not shown being part
of the final results.
becouse that character convert a execute line to a comment.
