-The way to add comments on ruby (unline and multiLine)

There are 2 ways to put comments in ruby one is using # followed by the comment 
and the second is using "= begin" followed by the comment and closing the comment
 with "= end"

-When you should use each type

 that is more than one line will use "= begin" and "= end"
