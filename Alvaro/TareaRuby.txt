Questions!  

1.- What is  ruby ?
Ruby is a programming language object-oriented and open source, focused on simplicity 
whit natural syntax to read and easy to write

2.-Pros and Cons explained in class

The pros more relevant for me are:

No need to include files and libreries 
Not many conditionals

the cons more relevants:

-No multiple inheritance
-Perhaps as against could say that is an interpreted language becouse a interpreter
 is usually much less efficient than the execution of a compiled program.
 It is not time efficient because each instruction must go through an interpretation
 at runtime, or as in more recent implementations, the code must be compiled to a
 intermediate representation before each run

3.- which they are the three stages of testing?
ui (user interface)
services
Backend
